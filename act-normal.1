.SH NAME
normal \- A guide for acting like a reasonable person around women.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B normal
[\fIRESPECT\fR] [\fILISTEN\fR] [\fICOMMON_SENSE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B normal
is a conceptual tool to help individuals interact with women (or anyone) in a way that is considerate, respectful, and appropriate.

The program assumes the user already has basic social skills and seeks only to refine their execution.

.SH USAGE
Acting normal around a female involves the following steps:

.TP
.B 1. Respect
Understand that she is an individual with her own thoughts, feelings, and preferences. Treat her as you would want to be treated, with kindness and dignity. Don't make weird hand gestures, ask prying questions, ask to reveal body parts to you, or touch her body parts without consent.

.TP
.B 2. Listen
Pay attention to what she says. Avoid interrupting, and show genuine interest in the conversation. If you're not interested in the conversation, share some of your interests with her. If she's not interested, maybe talk about the weather.

.TP
.B 3. Common Sense
Behave in a way that aligns with common courtesy. For example:
- Don't stare.
- Respect personal space.
- Avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes.
- Do not molest, touch, grope, feel, poke, prod or kiss without consent

.SH EXAMPLES
.B Example 1:
Meeting someone for the first time:
.PP
\fB"Hi, I'm John. Nice to meet you!"\fR (Offer a handshake, smile politely)

.B Example 2:
Having a conversation:
.PP
\fB"That’s interesting! Could you tell me more about your work?"\fR (Show curiosity about her thoughts, not just your own.)

.B Example 3:
Dealing with disagreement:
.PP
\fB"I see your point, though I think I’d approach it differently. What do you think?"\fR (Respect differing opinions.)

.SH WARNINGS
- Avoid condescending behavior such as mansplaining.
- Do not overthink or assume all interactions need to be extraordinary. Being authentic is often enough.
